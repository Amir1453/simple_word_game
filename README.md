# Simple Word Game

Python Based Simple Word Game

I made this project long ago based on a discord bot game that I played on a server. 

The code takes as input a string, and will return the longest word that is in words_alpha.txt that contains all the characters in the inputted string.

This was made to beat people in a very specific game, however I do not remember the details currently.
